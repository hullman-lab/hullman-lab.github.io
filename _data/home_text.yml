- <em>We model decisions made with and by model predictions, with an aim of achieving "model" decisions&mdash;those that optimally combine human domain knowledge and causal flexibility with the strengths of modern AI.</em>
- As impressive but often brittle new AI capabilities emerge, we need rigorous methods for combining and evaluating human and artificial intelligence. Models present us with new inputs to important decisions&mdash;about health, science, politics, and so on&mdash;but how do we identify their potential to improve existing processes or diagnose sources of real-world use? How do we pinpoint and preserve unique aspects of human problem solving, and design for the complementary strengths of different agents working together on complex decision problems?
- Our lab pursues statistical foundations for collaboration with AI. Our goal is to ground approaches to AI-assisted decision-making, interpretability, explainability, uncertainty quantification, and related topics in theoretical frameworks for inference and decision-making, so that we can make the most of AI for real-world problems.
